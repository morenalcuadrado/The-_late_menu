Hey guys. This is part of a series of practices that I will be uploading so you can see my skills, abilities and knowledge. 
Also as a guide for those who are just starting out and who knows someone might like what I do. 
Create the headers. The body with the contents divided by sections. Then create the footer. 
Styles: I must confess that it was a challenge to the point that I wanted to add a background image, but there was no chance. 
If anyone knows how to do it I'd appreciate your help, and I did read how to do it but it didn't work. As for the placement of the images of the food, I wanted to place them next to the price but I didn't think they would look good so I chose to place them underneath. 
If you got here, thanks for commenting and for following my journey through this coding world.

Update:
Since commit: Adding classes for color. There are variations in both the HTML and CSS, it is preferable to take the new code.
